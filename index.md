## favorie CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 4, part 2

  My second favorite lab was lab 4 part 2. In this lab, we made a number game where the second player guesses player oneâ€™s secret number. It was fun running this code with my partner, which is why I enjoyed it more than other labs. 

* Lab 6, part 2

  My favorite lab was lab 6 because this was the first actual game we attempted to code other than the number-guessing lab. It was interesting to see how BlackJack works through code. I want to code games in the future, so this lab was ultimately my favorite.
  
* Lab 7

  I enjoyed lab 7 because it was challenging. I ran into many errors but was able to overcome those challenges which made me feel accomplished. It was also interesting how a computer can hold that much information and always tell you if you can or can't park.
