Hello! My name is Dariela, and I attend Cal State Fullerton. I recently changed my major to computer science and expect to graduate in 2026-2027.

## favorie CPSC 120L labs

* [Lab 4, part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-04-dariela-del-toro-ilaria-dettmer-1/blob/main/part-2/hilo.cc)

  I enjoyed lab 4, part 2 because we created a game where player one gives a secret number, and player two has two atempts to get it correct. I enjoyed running this code with my partner, which is why I found this lab more fun than others.

* [Lab 5, part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-05-dariela-and-ilaria-lab-5/blob/main/part-2/dffi.cc)

  I really enjoyed lab 5, part 2 because it was challenging compared to the previous labs. Although I ran into many errors, I was able to overcome those challenges which made me feel accomplished. I also think this was the first lab where we made our computer make calculations through code, which i found interesting.


* [Lab 6, part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-06-dariela-and-ilaria-lab-6/blob/main/part-2/blackjack.cc)

  My favorite lab was lab 6 because this was the first actual in depth game we attempted to code other than the number-guessing game. It was interesting to see how BlackJack works through code. I want to code games in the future, so this lab was ultimately my favorite.
