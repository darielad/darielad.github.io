I recently changed my major to computer science and expect to graduate in 2026-27.

## favorie CPSC 120L laba

* Lab 4, part 2

  My second favorite lab was lab 04 part 2. In this lab, we made a number game where the second player guesses player oneâ€™s secret number. It was fun running this code with my partner, which is why I enjoyed it more than other labs. 

* Lab 7

  My favorite lab was lab 07 because this was the first actual game we attempted to code other than the number-guessing lab. It was interesting to see how BlackJack works through code. I want to code games in the future, so this lab was ultimately my favorite.
